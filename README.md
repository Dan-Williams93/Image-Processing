# C-Image-Processing
Image Processing using Nearest Neighbour Search algorithms

This applicaton uses various NNS algorithms to process specific images in C++.

The application is capable of removing noise through a thresholding process, furthermore the application is also capable of reconstructing an image that has been split into blocks and randomly shuffled.

The secondary functionality of this application is to find a specified sample of a larger parent image. In the case of this project the aim was to find Wally in a large scene.
